# JavaScript Backend Project

This is a backend project built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, implementing core concepts of backend development such as user authentication, protected routes, secure cookie handling, and proper MVC folder structure.<br/><br/> This project is built as part of my self-learning journey. I learned from YouTube and implemented everything step by step to understand real-world backend systems deeply.

## Features

- User Registration & Login
- JWT-based Authentication
- Secure cookie implementation
- Protected Routes using Middleware
- MongoDB database integration using Mongoose
- Environment-based configuration using dotenv
- Clean and modular MVC folder structure
  
## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- **dotenv**
  
## What I Learned
